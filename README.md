Slamy's VRC6 Volume Test 0.1

According to a few sources I could find, it's specified that the maximum volume of the
pulse waves should be about as loud on the VRC6 as on the internal APU.

With FamiTracker this is the case for example.

Sadly not with nestopia which I've used as reference for this program as the VRC6 is a bit louder than the APU.
So I've used volume F for APU and volume E for VRC6 which is about right on nestopia.

Consider visiting the forum of krikzz.com for further tipps.

This program shall help you to verify your configuration by outputting 440 Hz pulse waves.

Hold A for a VRC6 pulse wave.
Hold B for an APU pulse wave.
Hold Start for an alternation between APU and VRC6.

You also might hear a stutter with the alternation mode. But this a bug of this program.
