Slamy's VRC6 Volume Test 0.1

According to a few sources I could find, it's specified that the maximum volume of the
pulse waves should be about as loud on the VRC6 as on the internal APU.
With FamiTracker this is the case for example. Sadly not with nestopia I've used as reference.
This program shall help you to verify your configuration by outputting 440 Hz pulse waves.

Consider visiting the forum of krikzz.com for further tipps.

Hold A for a VRC6 pulse wave.
Hold B for an APU pulse wave.
Hold Start for an alternation between APU and VRC6.

You also might hear a stutter. But this a bug of this program.
